# Arduino-Micro-Servo-Control-with-Button

## Contextualization
In this experiment, the micro servo on PWM pin 11 will be controlled by a button. When the button is pressed, it will hold the signal, maintaining the action of the servo. To represent this, the LED on pin 13 will indicate when the circuit is on or off. The micro servo will move from 0 to 180 degrees when it is turned on.
